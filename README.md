# PongGame
### Classic Pong Game Inspired By DOOM
##### Exercise requirements:
- A character controlled by the player: user control the blue left paddle
- Computer controlled character:  Computer control the red right paddle
- Obstacles through which the characters cannot pass: The ball and the paddles cannot leave the boundaries of the screen
- Interesting happenings that occur when characters run into each other: 
-- When the ball hits the pan it makes a collision that causes it to increase its speed slightly
--When the player (user or computer) lose and miss the ball, he loses a heart
- Opening screen, game screen, and result screen
